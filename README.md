This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in PHP: the silent creation of undefined array keys. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using `isset()` to prevent unexpected behavior.  The issue arises when attempting to access or modify an array element that doesn't exist. Instead of throwing an error, PHP silently creates the key with a default value (usually 0), potentially leading to difficult-to-trace errors in larger projects.  The solution highlights how to check for the existence of a key before accessing it, improving the code's robustness and predictability.
