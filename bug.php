In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:  `$myArray['missingKey']++;`  If `'missingKey'` doesn't exist, instead of throwing an error, PHP silently creates it with a value of 0, then increments it to 1. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues, especially in larger applications where you might not be aware of the implicit key creation. This is different from many other languages which may raise an exception.
